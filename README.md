# Biological-coding-projects
These are some genetic analysis projects that I did in 2020
CountSARS & count E_coli - counts the number of neucleotides present
Proteins of SarsVirus - separates Genome into proteins
Six Frame Translation of SARS - Prints the Six frame analysis of a genome
AsianFlush - determines whether someone has a mutation that causes asian flush by looking at chromosome 12
SortAnimals - arranges a set of animals on terms of genetic similarity with whales
GC_of_SARS_and_E_Coli - finds the percentage of each amino acid in a genome.
