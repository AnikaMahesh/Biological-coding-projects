# Biological-coding-projects

This Repository contains code resources for the below Genome Analysis Projects, done as part of Coding for Medicine Summary Camp in 2020 (coding4medicine.com)

1. CountSARS.py & countE_Coli.py - Very Simple program to counts the number of neucleotides present from nucleotide sequences in FASTA files

2. Protiens_of_SarsVirus.py - Program to separate Genome into proteins using Biopython

3. Six_frame_translation_of_SARS.py : Six phase translation of SARSVirus Genome from Proteins using Biopython

4. AsianFlush.py : program to determine if a mutation that causes Asian flush is present in chromosome 12

5. SortAnimals.py : program to arrange a set of animals in terms of genetic similarity with whales

6. GC_of_SARS_and_E_Coli.py - program to find percentage of each amino acid in a genome.
